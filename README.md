## 💫 Hi there, I'm Ian

I’m a systems-focused developer who enjoys building fast, reliable, and low-level software.

My work spans across C++, Go, and x86-64 assembly, with a growing interest in cryptography, file-encryption pipelines, and kernel-level development.

For any inquiries, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:dr8co@duck.com).

## 🛠️ What I Work On

* **🧩 Systems & low-level engineering** (C, C++, x86-64 assembly)

* **🔐 Security & cryptography tooling**
  * PQC integration
  * Secure keypair handling
  * AEAD modes, KDFs, and file/folder encryption designs

* **🧪 Developer tooling**
  * CLI tooling for Unix systems (Linux/macOS)

* **⚡ High-performance code**
  * Profiling, benchmarking, and optimization

## 🚀 Current Focus

* Building a **secure file encryption tool** with modern cryptographic algorithms and strong security guarantees.
* Exploring **kernel development**, x86-64 assembly, and OS internals.
* Enhancing my knowledge of **post-quantum cryptography** and its practical applications.
* Learning Rust more deeply for systems and tooling.
* Continuing to explore SIMD and low-level CPU behavior.

## 💻 Tech I Enjoy

**Languages:** C, C++, Rust, x86-64 asm, Go, Python, JavaScript

**Tools:** Git, Clang, GCC, GDB, LLDB, Valgrind, perf, CMake

**Cloud & Infra:** AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, Vagrant, Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, CircleCI

**Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Unix internals

## 🧠 What Drives Me

I like understanding how things work **under the hood**, from CPU instructions to OS subsystems to cryptographic primitives.

I build tools that are **predictable**, **transparent**, and **high-performance**, and I value clean API design backed by strong engineering principles.

## 📈 Always Learning

Whether it's kernel development, advanced cryptographic constructions, or squeezing nanoseconds out of code paths, I'm always digging deeper.
